## Architecture
Below is the current architecture for EpiSync Data Dictionary that addresses the following requirements:
- Data Elements Stored in secure database, managed by existing tooling and best-practices
- Allow multiple users to access and manage the data dictionary without conflict, data integrity errors, or other similar concerns
- Allow stored data dictionary elements to be serialized into various formats such as JSON, CSV, HTML etc
- Fully dynamic and data driven (i.e. nothing is static)
- Easy to change, extend and manage
- Prevent logical errors or data corruption
- Supports transactional modifications
- Supports data element value constraints
- Re-uses existing architecture components and technology
- Cloud neutral
